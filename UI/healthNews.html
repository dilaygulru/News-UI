                                restricting non-emergency services at U.S. hospitals. Though many of those jobs have
                                since returned, health care employment remains below pre-pandemic levels, with the

                                Staffing shortages are now the nation’s top patient safety concern, forcing Americans to
                                endure longer wait times when seeking care “even in life-threatening emergencies,” or to
                                be turned away entirely, according to ECRI, a nonprofit patient safety organization.</p>
